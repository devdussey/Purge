**Date:** October 4, 2025

---

## Summary

Implemented Phase 1 AI enhancements for Purge™ crypto protection antivirus, created trademark materials, and developed complete branding assets.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. **Phase 1: AI Enhancements** ✅

#### ML-Powered Address Swap Detection
- **Risk scoring system (0-100%)**
  - Timing analysis (<500ms = 40pts, <1s = 30pts, <2s = 20pts)
  - Known scam patterns (50pts)
  - Address similarity detection (15pts)
  - Frequency analysis (20pts if seen 3+ times)
  - Historical pattern matching (15pts)
  - Address type mismatch (10pts)

- **Auto-blocking:** 70%+ risk score = automatic block & clipboard restore
- **Detection methods:** timing, pattern, behavioral, ml
- **ML Persistence:** Patterns saved to localStorage, loads on restart

#### Enhanced Phishing Detection
- **9-layer AI-powered analysis:**
  1. Homograph/lookalike attacks (50pts)
  2. Suspicious TLDs (.tk, .ml, etc.) (25pts)
  3. IP address detection (35pts)
  4. Excessive subdomains (20pts)
  5. Suspicious keywords in path (15pts)
  6. Punycode/IDN homograph attacks (40pts)
  7. New domain detection (15pts)
  8. Community reporting system (30pts)
  9. URL shortener detection (20pts)

- **Risk threshold:** 40+ = phishing detected
- **Detection indicators:** Category, severity (high/medium/low), description

#### UI Enhancements
- Risk scores with color coding (Red 70%+, Yellow 40-69%, Green <40%)
- Detection method badges (ML/Pattern/Behavioral/Heuristic/Community)
- Detailed threat indicators with categories
- Enhanced threat visualization
