- ✅ Pattern learning from historical threats
- ✅ Behavioral analysis (timing patterns, frequency analysis)
- ✅ Risk-based auto-blocking (70% threshold)
- ✅ Multi-factor detection:
  - Timing analysis (<500ms = 40pts, <1s = 30pts, <2s = 20pts)
  - Known scam patterns (50pts)
  - Address similarity detection (15pts)
  - Frequency analysis (20pts if seen 3+ times)
  - Historical pattern matching (15pts)
  - Address type mismatch detection (10pts)
- ✅ Detection methods: timing, pattern, behavioral, ml

#### 2. Smart Phishing Detection ✅
- ✅ Enhanced AI-powered URL analysis (9 detection methods)
- ✅ Homograph/lookalike attacks (50pts)
- ✅ Suspicious TLDs (.tk, .ml, etc.) (25pts)
- ✅ IP address detection (35pts)
- ✅ Excessive subdomains (20pts)
- ✅ Suspicious keywords in path (15pts)
- ✅ Punycode/IDN homograph attacks (40pts)
- ✅ New domain detection (15pts)
- ✅ Community reporting system (30pts)
- ✅ URL shortener detection (20pts)
- ✅ Risk threshold: 40+ = phishing
- ✅ Detection indicators with severity levels (high/medium/low)

#### 3. Real-time Risk Scoring ✅
- ✅ 0-100 risk scoring for all threats
- ✅ Visual risk indicators in UI
- ✅ Detection method badges (pattern/ml/heuristic/community)
- ✅ Detailed threat indicators with categories
- ✅ Auto-blocking based on risk thresholds

## 🚀 Roadmap

### Phase 2: Predictive Protection (Weeks 3-4)
- Transaction intent analysis
- Pre-transaction scanning
- Smart contract analysis
- Gas fee anomaly detection
- Destination address reputation

### Phase 3: Advanced AI (Weeks 5-6)
- AI security assistant (natural language)
- Explain threats in plain English
- Zero-day protection via anomaly detection
- Community threat intelligence

---

## 💼 Business Plan

### Beta Testing (After Phase 1 - Week 3)
- Target: 100-500 beta users
- Need: Analytics, telemetry, crash reporting
- Platform: Discord/Telegram community

### Partnership Strategy (After Beta Success)
**Targets:**
- Wallet providers: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger
- Exchanges: Coinbase, Binance
- Security firms: CertiK, Hacken

**Approach:** Proven metrics from beta (threats blocked, users protected)

### IP Protection
- ❌ Don't patent (prior art exists, not novel)
- ✅ Trademark brand "Purge"
- ✅ Keep AI models proprietary (trade secret)
- ✅ Focus on speed-to-market & execution

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### AI Models Used
- Anthropic Claude (via SDK) - for content analysis
- Pattern matching algorithms
- Heuristic detection engines

### Key Files
- `/src/services/CryptoProtection.ts` - Clipboard monitoring
- `/src/services/PhishingDetection.ts` - URL analysis
- `/src/components/CryptoProtection.tsx` - Crypto protection UI
- `/src/components/PhishingChecker.tsx` - Phishing UI
- `/src/components/Settings.tsx` - Comprehensive settings panel
- `/src/hooks/useSettings.ts` - Settings persistence hook
- `/src/types/settings.ts` - Settings data model (40+ settings)
- `/electron/main.ts` - Electron main process (CommonJS)
- `/electron/preload.ts` - IPC bridge
- `/tsconfig.electron.json` - Electron build config (CommonJS output)

---

## 📝 Recent Session Notes (2025-10-04 PM)

### Settings System Implementation ✅
**What was built:**
- Complete settings data model with 40+ configurable options across 8 categories
- Auto-save to localStorage AND Electron store (`%APPDATA%/Purge/settings.json`)
- Settings UI with collapsible sections, toggles, sliders, dropdowns
- Import/Export functionality
- Reset to defaults

**Settings Categories:**
1. Protection (real-time, cloud, behavior, ransomware)
2. Scan (depth, archives, removable media, auto-quarantine)
3. Performance (CPU limits, scheduled scans)
4. Updates (auto-update definitions & app)
5. Notifications (alerts, sounds)
6. Crypto Protection (clipboard monitoring, risk thresholds)
7. Advanced (telemetry, logging, quarantine retention)
8. UI (theme, compact mode)

### Theme System Implementation ✅
**Fixed issues:**
- Module system conflict (ES modules vs CommonJS in Electron)
- Changed Electron build to output `.cjs` files (CommonJS)
- Updated `tsconfig.electron.json` to use `module: "CommonJS"`
- Auto-rename `.js` to `.cjs` in build script
- Updated package.json scripts to use `main.cjs`

**Theme toggle now works:**
- Light/Dark/Auto modes
- Theme persists via settings
- CSS styling for both modes implemented in `index.css`
- Light mode: soft blue-gray gradient, white cards, dark text
- Dark mode: black gradient, dark cards, light text
- `useEffect` watches `settings` object for changes

### Technical Fixes Applied
1. **Preload script error**: Fixed by using CommonJS modules instead of ES modules
2. **Theme not applying**: Fixed by watching entire `settings` object in dependency array
3. **Light mode styling**: Added comprehensive CSS overrides in `index.css`
4. **Build automation**: Auto-rename to `.cjs` in `scripts/build-electron.js`

### Commands to Run App
```bash
# Build and run
npm run build-electron && npm run electron

# Development mode (with hot reload)
npm run electron-dev
```

### Known Issues
- GPU cache errors (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)
- Dev mode may have port conflicts (use production build)

## 📝 Notes for Future Sessions
- Settings system is fully functional and ready to wire to features
- Theme toggle working - test by changing Settings → Interface → Theme
- Next: Integrate settings into scan behavior, notifications, etc.
- Current focus: Settings complete, ready for Phase 2 features
