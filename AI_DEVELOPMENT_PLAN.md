# Purge AI Development Plan & Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Vision
Advanced antivirus with **unique crypto wallet protection** powered by AI. Features that McAfee/Norton don't have:
- Real-time clipboard monitoring for address swaps
- AI-powered phishing detection
- Smart contract analysis
- Behavioral malware detection

---

## 📋 Current Status (2025-10-04)

### ✅ Completed Features
- Crypto clipboard protection (basic)
- Address swap detection for BTC, ETH, XMR, LTC, SOL, ADA
- Phishing URL checker with pattern matching
- Wallet file monitoring
- Real-time threat alerts
- Threat history & stats

### ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETED (2025-10-04)

#### 1. ML-Powered Address Swap Detection ✅
- ✅ Confidence scoring (0-100 risk score)
- ✅ Pattern learning from historical threats
- ✅ Behavioral analysis (timing patterns, frequency analysis)
- ✅ Risk-based auto-blocking (70% threshold)
- ✅ Multi-factor detection:
  - Timing analysis (<500ms = 40pts, <1s = 30pts, <2s = 20pts)
  - Known scam patterns (50pts)
  - Address similarity detection (15pts)
  - Frequency analysis (20pts if seen 3+ times)
  - Historical pattern matching (15pts)
  - Address type mismatch detection (10pts)
- ✅ Detection methods: timing, pattern, behavioral, ml

#### 2. Smart Phishing Detection ✅
- ✅ Enhanced AI-powered URL analysis (9 detection methods)
- ✅ Homograph/lookalike attacks (50pts)
- ✅ Suspicious TLDs (.tk, .ml, etc.) (25pts)
- ✅ IP address detection (35pts)
- ✅ Excessive subdomains (20pts)
- ✅ Suspicious keywords in path (15pts)
- ✅ Punycode/IDN homograph attacks (40pts)
- ✅ New domain detection (15pts)
- ✅ Community reporting system (30pts)
- ✅ URL shortener detection (20pts)
- ✅ Risk threshold: 40+ = phishing
- ✅ Detection indicators with severity levels (high/medium/low)

#### 3. Real-time Risk Scoring ✅
- ✅ 0-100 risk scoring for all threats
- ✅ Visual risk indicators in UI
- ✅ Detection method badges (pattern/ml/heuristic/community)
- ✅ Detailed threat indicators with categories
- ✅ Auto-blocking based on risk thresholds

## 🚀 Roadmap

### Phase 2: Predictive Protection (Weeks 3-4)
- Transaction intent analysis
- Pre-transaction scanning
- Smart contract analysis
- Gas fee anomaly detection
- Destination address reputation

### Phase 3: Advanced AI (Weeks 5-6)
- AI security assistant (natural language)
- Explain threats in plain English
- Zero-day protection via anomaly detection
- Community threat intelligence

---

## 💼 Business Plan

### Beta Testing (After Phase 1 - Week 3)
- Target: 100-500 beta users
- Need: Analytics, telemetry, crash reporting
- Platform: Discord/Telegram community

### Partnership Strategy (After Beta Success)
**Targets:**
- Wallet providers: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger
- Exchanges: Coinbase, Binance
- Security firms: CertiK, Hacken

**Approach:** Proven metrics from beta (threats blocked, users protected)

### IP Protection
- ❌ Don't patent (prior art exists, not novel)
- ✅ Trademark brand "Purge"
- ✅ Keep AI models proprietary (trade secret)
- ✅ Focus on speed-to-market & execution

---

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### AI Models Used
- Anthropic Claude (via SDK) - for content analysis
- Pattern matching algorithms
- Heuristic detection engines

### Key Files
- `/src/services/CryptoProtection.ts` - Clipboard monitoring
- `/src/services/PhishingDetection.ts` - URL analysis
- `/src/components/CryptoProtection.tsx` - UI
- `/src/components/PhishingChecker.tsx` - Phishing UI
